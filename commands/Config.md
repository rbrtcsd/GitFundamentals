# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to ste up your identity. 

Your identity can be set up with the commands: 

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name" 

git config --global user.email youremail@gmail.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
